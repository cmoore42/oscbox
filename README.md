# oscbox
Encoders for the ETC EOS family of lighting consoles using OSC and an Orange Pi Zero

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to create encoder wheels for the ETC EOS family of lighting software.
Specifically, the target is a PC or Mac running the EOS software.
It's possible this would work with a physical lighting console but it hasn't been tested.

The project was inspired by ETC's "lighthack" project.  
Their "box_1" implements two encoder wheels, one for PAN and one for TILT.
I wanted the same, but I wanted four wheels to match the wheels on an Ion console, 
and I wanted the wheels to be multi-function like the console wheels are.
